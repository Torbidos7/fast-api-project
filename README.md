# FastAPI Project

This is a repository for my FastAPI project. It represent a trial to learn how to build FastAPI apps. 

I followed the [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLKKmouUams) for the *student_app.py*.


## Getting started

To get started, make sure to:
1. clone the *repository* containing the code.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Torbidos7/fast-api-project.git
   ```
2. installing the required dependencies (*uvicorn*, *fastAPI*)
3. Run the following command on the terminal:
      ```bash
   uvicorn student_app:app --reload
   ```
4. Go to *http://127.0.0.1:8000/* to activate the check activation of local server.
